# rtl.wtf Wordpress Theme

This is a Wordpress theme for the rtl.wtf and ltr.wtf websites. It is meant to be used on these sites specifically, but can potentially be used for other Wordpress installations that require different site names and rtl-ready design.

# Development
This theme was created by Moriel Schottlender and is distributed under GPLv2 license.

The initial structure of this template was created with http://underscores.me/ and was then heavily adjusted. It follows the GPLv2 license. Please see the site for full license.

Please be aware that this theme is still under development and may behave unexpectedly if used in other domains!

# Usage
Please note: This was created specifically for rtl.wtf and ltr.wtf and may need to be specifically adjusted if used outside.

Please report bugs! if you are using this template elsewhere or if you're interested in using it elsewhere, please let me know, I will be happy to help in the migration.
